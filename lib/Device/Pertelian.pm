=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

If you have a Pertelian X2040 USB LCD screen, then you can do
things with it.

    use Device::Pertelian;

    my $lcd = Device::Pertelian->new('/dev/ttyUSB0');
    $lcd->clearscreen();

    # write to the top row
    $lcd->writeline(0, "Hello, world!");
    ...

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor accepts one parameter, $device, which is a path in /dev.
You may find it out from your logs.

=cut

sub new {
    my $self = shift;
    my $device = shift;

    unless (ref $self) {
        $self = fields::new($self);
    }

    if ($device) {
        $self->_open($device);
    }

    return $self;
}

sub _open {
    my ($self, $device) = @_;

    open $self->{_fh}, '>', $device
        or return;

    $self->{_fh}->autoflush(1);

    foreach (0x38, 0x06, 0x10, 0x0c) {
        $self->_writeout(pack('CC', 0xfe, $_));
    }

    return 1;
}

sub _writeout {
    my ($self, $buf) = @_;

    if ($self->{_fh}) {
        print {$self->{_fh}} $buf;
        usleep(1000);
    }
}

=head2 clearscreen

This function does a simple thing -- clears all the 4 lines of the screen.

=cut

=head2 writeline

This function takes two parameters, $row and $text. The screen has 4 rows,
so you may pass a number from 0 to 3 as $row and the $text should be
under 20 characters, that is the width of the screen.

=cut

sub writeline {
    my $self = shift;

    my ($row, $text) = @_;
    my @rowvals = (
        0x80,
        0x80 + 0x40,
        0x80 + 0x14,
        0x80 + 0x54);
    my $buf = pack('CC', 0xfe, $rowvals[$row]);
    $self->_writeout($buf);

    foreach (split(//, $text)) {
        $self->_writeout($_);
    }

    return 1;
}

sub clearscreen {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->_writeout(pack('CC', 0xfe, 1));
    usleep(10000);
}
