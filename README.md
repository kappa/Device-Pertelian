# NAME

Device::Pertelian - a driver for the Pertelian X2040 USB LCD

# VERSION

Version 0.02

# SYNOPSIS

If you have a Pertelian X2040 USB LCD screen, then you can do
things with it.

    use Device::Pertelian;

    my $lcd = Device::Pertelian->new('/dev/ttyUSB0');
    $lcd->clearscreen();

    # write to the top row
    $lcd->writeline(0, "Hello, world!");
    ...

# METHODS

## new

The constructor accepts one parameter, $device, which is a path in /dev.
You may find it out from your logs.

## clearscreen

This function does a simple thing -- clears all the 4 lines of the screen.

## writeline

This function takes two parameters, $row and $text. The screen has 4 rows,
so you may pass a number from 0 to 3 as $row and the $text should be
under 20 characters, that is the width of the screen.
